# Core Components Issues and Recommendations

This document outlines critical issues identified in core components of the trading system that should be addressed before considering the system production-ready.

## 1. Thread Safety Issues

### 1.1 Thread Utils Lambda Capture

**File:** `/common/thread_utils.h`

**Issue:** The `createAndStartThread` function uses a dangling reference in its lambda capture `[&]()` which captures local variables by reference in a thread that might outlive those variables.

**Recommendation:** Replace with a copy capture to ensure thread safety:
```cpp
auto t = new std::thread([thread_core_id = core_id, thread_name = name, func = std::forward<T>(func), ... args = std::forward<A>(args)]() {
  // Function body
});
```

## 2. Error Handling Gaps

### 2.1 Incomplete Order Server Error Handling

**File:** `/exchange/order_server/order_server.h`

**Issues:**
- TODO comments indicating incomplete error handling
- Missing rejection responses for sequence number mismatches and socket mismatches

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper rejection responses to clients when validations fail
- Add sequence number gap detection and recovery
- Improve logging for connection and validation issues

### 2.2 Trade Engine Error Handling

**File:** `/trading/strategy/trade_engine.cpp`

**Issues:**
- No exception handling in the main processing loop
- No validation of market updates and client responses
- No heartbeat or health monitoring

**Recommendations:**
- Add structured exception handling with recovery mechanisms
- Implement validation for all incoming messages
- Add heartbeat mechanism to detect stalled market data or response processing
- Implement idle detection and recovery

## 3. Risk Management Enhancements

### 3.1 Limited Risk Controls

**File:** `/trading/strategy/risk_manager.h`

**Issues:**
- Basic position, order size, and P&L checks only
- No circuit breakers or kill switches
- No rate limiting for order submissions
- No market volatility detection

**Recommendations:**
- Add circuit breakers based on market conditions
- Implement order rate limiting to prevent excessive submissions
- Add notional value checks (price * quantity)
- Add max daily loss limits and trailing stop mechanisms
- Implement market volatility detection and risk reduction

### 3.2 Position Keeper Improvements

**File:** `/trading/strategy/position_keeper.h`

**Issues:**
- Limited position tracking
- No stress testing or "what-if" scenarios

**Recommendations:**
- Add robust P&L calculations with mark-to-market updates
- Implement position limits by notional value
- Add stress testing to simulate extreme market movements

## 4. Performance Monitoring

### 4.1 Limited Latency Measurement

**Issues:**
- Basic performance measurement with macros
- No systematic latency recording or alerting

**Recommendations:**
- Enhance performance monitoring with detailed latency statistics
- Add high-water mark detection for processing times
- Implement alerting for abnormal latency patterns

## 5. Resilience and Recovery

### 5.1 Missing Reconnection Logic

**Issues:**
- Limited recovery from failures
- No systematic reconnection strategies

**Recommendations:**
- Add robust recovery procedures for all failure scenarios
- Implement backoff strategies for reconnections
- Add state recovery mechanisms after restarts

## 6. Testing Coverage

### 6.1 Insufficient Test Coverage

**Issues:**
- Limited test coverage for core components
- No stress or edge case testing

**Recommendations:**
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for all core components
- Add integration tests that cover failure scenarios
- Implement performance and stress tests
- Add simulation testing for market scenarios

## Next Steps

These issues should be addressed in phases:
1. Critical safety issues (thread safety, error handling)
2. Risk management enhancements
3. Performance monitoring improvements
4. Resilience mechanisms
5. Test coverage expansion

Each phase should include thorough testing before moving to production.
