## Design Decisions

### WebSocket Implementation
- Using Boost.Beast for WebSocket connections
- Implemented automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Added support for SSL/TLS for secure connections
- Message handler callback approach for decoupling message processing

### Order Book Management
- Maintaining full depth order book with price mapping
- Implementing sequence validation to ensure data integrity
- Using the REST API for initial snapshots and recovery
- Supporting refresh/rebuild when sequence gaps are detected

### Data Conversion
- Converting string prices and quantities to internal integer format
- Generating synthetic order IDs for price levels
- Creating market updates for complete book snapshots
- Handling incremental updates for efficient updates

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement BinanceHttpClient for REST API calls
2. ✅ Complete BinanceMarketDataConsumer implementation
3. ✅ Implement order execution gateway
4. ✅ Implement JSON-based configuration system
5. ✅ Implement balance checking and order quantity calculation
6. ✅ Test with Binance testnet for basic order operations
7. Add unit tests for all components
8. Integrate with user data stream for live order updates
9. Complete market data integration with event handling
10. Performance optimization
11. Integration with existing trading strategies

## Open Questions

- How to handle Binance's rate limits effectively? (Basic implementation complete)
- Best approach for reconnection during exchange outages? (Basic implementation with exponential backoff)
- Optimal caching strategy for order status information? (Initial implementation with cache durations in config)
- How to effectively translate between decimal prices in Binance and the internal price representation? (Initial implementation using PRICE_FILTER)

## Recent Updates (May 17, 2025)

1. **Configuration System Enhancement**:
   - Created `BinanceConfig` class with JSON-based configuration
   - Added support for multiple symbols with ticker ID mapping
   - Implemented caching mechanisms for exchange information
   - Fixed uninitialized variables error in the default ticker info handling

2. **Order Gateway Improvements**:
   - Implemented order submission and cancellation
   - Added price filtering and validation against exchange rules
   - Added balance checking to prevent insufficient balance errors
   - Added order quantity calculation based on available funds
   - Fixed JSON parsing errors in order response handling

3. **Testing Framework**:
   - Created test_order_gateway for testing order operations
   - Implemented test_binance for market data integration testing
   - All basic tests are passing with Binance testnet

4. **Security Improvements**:
   - Added vault directory to .gitignore
   - Implemented secure credential storage and loading
